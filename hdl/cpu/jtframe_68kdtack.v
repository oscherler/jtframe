/*

    Generates the standard /DTACK signal expected by the CPU,
    i.e. there is an idle cycle for each bus cycle

    If there is a special bus access, marked by bus_cs, and
    it takes longer to complete than one cycle, the extra time
    will be recovered for later. If bus_legit is high, the time
    will not be recovered as it is identified as legitim wait
    in the original system

    DSn -and not just ASn- must be used so read-modify-write
    instructions have a second /DTACK signal generated for
    the write cycle

    Note that if jtframe_ramrq is used, then DSn must also
    gate the SDRAM requests so you get a cs toggle in the
    middle of the read-modify-write cycles

    DSn goes low one cycle after ASn under some conditions, so
    if ASn | DSn is used to set DTACKn, it will take one more
    cycle than expected on those occasions. Both CPS and S16
    use only ASn to generate DTACKn.
